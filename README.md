# ViT-Notes
This is a repository for recoding the knowledge during Vision Transformer learning.

## Prerequisites


## Update Log
`models/transformer.py` references [[1]](#reference) to reproduce the architecture.

`models/vit_mnist.py` references [[2]](#reference) and [[3]](#reference) to reproduce and train a ViT model on MNIST dataset.<br>
<sub>*Modify the architecture based on [[3]](#reference) to accelerate the efficiency and maintain the accuracy*</sub>
