# ViT-Notes
This is a repository for recoding the knowledge during Vision Transformer learning.

## Prerequisites
### Patch Embedding
First, we need to divide the image into patches and project these regions onto the feature space for obtain the image tokens. The Patch progress as follows:
```
Input Shape: (B, C, H, W)
Patch Progress:
1. Projection: (B, Embed_dim, H // Patch_size, W // Patch_size)
2. Flatten: (B, Embed_dim, H // Patch_size * W // Patch_size)
3. Transpose: (B, H // Patch_size * W // Patch_size, Embed_dim)
Output Shape: (B, N, M)
```
As initial input, `(B, C, H, W)` indicate the `Batch`, `Image channel`, `Height of image` and `Width of image`. As final result, `(B, N, M)` indicate the `Batch`,`Number of Patches` and `Channel of feature dimension` respectively.

Second, unlike Natural Language Processing (NLP) tokens as a continue sequence, we split our complete image matrix into seperate part. Therefore, **Positional Encoding** is essential for supporting the positional dependency between each patches. 


### Self-Attention Mechanism



### Weight Initialization
By default, `nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)` uses a small-variance initialization, which helps stabilize early training on ***large*** datasets.

For ***smaller*** or ***more difficult*** datasets, using a larger initialization variance can improve performance by increasing the diversity of early weight representations.
